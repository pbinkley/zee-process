"The Ukrainian state is reeling, unable to finance services its people desperately need. But billions in EU financial assistance are not free; they're loans, which #Ukraine will inevitably default on.  There is little oversight or assurance the funds are going where they should, in a country the EU Court of Auditors described as suffering from \"grand corruption.\" Meanwhile there is no follow-up on EU requirements that Ukraine upholds the rule of law and democracy, as Zelenskyy's government bans opposition parties, shutters critical media, and strips 70% of workers of their labour protections and collective bargaining rights, in a move denounced by trade unions across Europe.
